## Election Audit Overview
The purpose of the election audit was to identify the number of total votes cast in each county and to identity the winner by their number of votes and percentage of votes.  Later we were asked to provide information on voter turnout from each county.  We were asked to provide information on which county had the largest turnout by percentage votes and total count of votes.

## Election-Audit Summary:
Our analysis tools can breakdown information provided from the states or counties included in the election process.  We will turn the information into data showing the total votes cast, which will indicate the participation of the population in that state or county.  It will also accurately indicate the number of votes received by each candidate.  

Using the “for loop” function allows a script to put together states or counties that are part of the election audit.  The image 1 below will show the script that will be used to put together the data.



Using the “membership operator” and comparison operators” will calculate the data providing total vote count to each specific state or county.  Below image 2 will show the script used to analyze the data for each state or county.
